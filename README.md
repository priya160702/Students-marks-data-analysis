# Students-marks-data-analysis


In this project, I analyzed students' performance in exams, aiming to understand how various factors—such as economic, personal, and social influences—affect their scores. The key inferences drawn include strategies to improve students' performance in each test, identifying the major factors influencing test scores, and evaluating the effectiveness of test preparation courses, along with other relevant insights. Following this, Logistic Regression was employed to predict future performance outcomes.
